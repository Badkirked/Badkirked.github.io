    <ul>
        <li>Cypress Pine (Callitris glaucophylla) is a durable Australian softwood known for its termite resistance and natural decay resistance, making it ideal for both indoor and outdoor applications.</li>
        <li>Commonly referred to as White Cypress Pine or Murray Pine, it is found in central western Queensland and New South Wales.</li>
        <li>The heartwood ranges in color from light yellow through orange to light brown, sometimes with dark brown streaks, while the sapwood is a creamy white.</li>
        <li>Cypress Pine has a fine, even texture and generally straight grain, often featuring tight knots that enhance its decorative appeal.</li>
        <li>It is highly durable, with a lifespan of up to 50 years above ground and 25 years in-ground, making it suitable for fencing, decking, and other structural applications.</li>
        <li>Pre-drilling is recommended for nailing due to its tendency to split, but it grips screws extremely tightly.</li>
        <li>Cypress Pine is a sustainable choice due to its relatively fast growth and the minimal environmental impact of its harvesting.</li>
        <li>Primary applications include flooring, cladding, fencing, joinery, and decorative uses such as furniture and turnery.</li>
        <li>Commonly found in:
            <ul>
                <li>New South Wales: Central Western regions, including areas around Dubbo and Moree.</li>
                <li>Queensland: Central Western regions, including areas around Charleville and Longreach.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
