    <ul>
        <li>Blackbutt is a large Australian hardwood commonly used for structural and exterior applications, as well as for producing plywood.</li>
        <li>Also known as Coastal Blackbutt or Pink Blackbutt, with the botanical name Eucalyptus pilularis.</li>
        <li>The name "Blackbutt" came about due to the tree's appearance after bushfire, with the butt significantly darkened.</li>
        <li>Due to its quick growth and versatility, Blackbutt is a good plantation timber and a commonly available commercial hardwood in New South Wales and southern Queensland.</li>
        <li>The heartwood ranges from golden yellow to pale brown, sometimes with a slight pinkish color. Sapwood is much paler and resistant to lyctid borer attack.</li>
        <li>Blackbutt has an even texture and generally straight grain, making it appealing for interior use applications.</li>
        <li>Can be stained, painted, or polished, but may have issues with painting due to surface checking.</li>
        <li>High extractives in mature wood can cause problems with adhesives and staining on painted surfaces exposed to weather.</li>
        <li>Machines well but is only fair for steam bending.</li>
        <li>Provides good fire resistance and is one of seven hardwood timber species suitable for home construction in bushfire areas in Victoria.</li>
        <li>Strong and durable, suitable for a range of structural, exterior, and interior applications, including framework, decking, flooring, and poles.</li>
        <li>Commonly found in:
            <ul>
                <li>New South Wales: Sydney, Central Coast, Hunter Region (Newcastle, Cessnock, Singleton), North Coast (Coffs Harbour, Port Macquarie, Byron Bay)</li>
                <li>Queensland: Brisbane, Gold Coast, Sunshine Coast, Maryborough, Fraser Island</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
