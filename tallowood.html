    <h1>Tallowood</h1>
    <p>Tallowood is a durable and dense hardwood known for its yellowish-brown to olive green color. It features a straight grain pattern with a moderately coarse texture. This timber is highly valued in Australia for its strength and durability, making it a common choice for flooring. Its best feature is its resistance to wear.</p>
    
    <h2>About Turpentine</h2>
    <p>Turpentine is a large tree species occurring along the eastern coast of Australia from Bateman's Bay in New South Wales to Cooktown in North Queensland.</p>
    <p>The true wood of this species ranges in colour from deep red to red-brown. Sapwood is distinctively paler, often creamy. The texture of Turpentine timber is fine to medium but often wavy, with interlocked grain. It is relatively free of gum veins.</p>
    <p>Turpentine is extremely durable in above ground applications, where its life expectancy is in excess of 40 years. In-ground life expectancy ranges from 15 to 25 years. The timber of this species is termite-resistant, and untreated sapwood is immune to lyctid borer attack.</p>
    <p>Turpentine is the main Australian species for marine pilings, as its high silica content makes it resistant to Teredinidae marine borers. Other engineering applications include wharf and bridge construction (as both sawn and round timber), railway sleepers, and mining timbers. Construction applications include general house framing, flooring and decking, lining and cladding. Turpentine is an excellent timber for dance floors. It is also used in the construction of plywood, laminated beams and bench tops, and for joinery and parquetry. Other applications include boatbuilding (knees, gunwales, planking, decking) and the production of oyster stakes, wine casks, mallets, and bearings.</p>
    <p>Untreated timber of this species is equivalent to 'fire retardant treated timber' when tested in accordance with AS/NZS 3837. The bushfire rating of this species is expected to remain unchanged if assessed in accordance with proposed changes to the standard.</p>
